New features
------------

- :py:meth:`~._signals.lazy.LazySignal.compute` will now pass keyword arguments to the dask :meth:`dask.array.Array.compute` method. This enables setting the scheduler and the number of computational workers. (`#2971 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/2971>`_)
- Changes to :meth:`~.api.signals.BaseSignal.plot`:
  
  - Added horizontal figure layout choice when using the ``ipympl`` backend. The default layour can be set in the plot section of the preferences GUI. (`#3140 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3140>`_)
  
- Changes to :meth:`~.api.signals.Signal2D.find_peaks`:
  
  - Lazy signals return lazy peak signals
  - ``get_intensity`` argument added to get the intensity of the peaks
  - The signal axes are now stored in the ``metadata.Peaks.signal_axes`` attribute of the peaks' signal. (`#3142 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3142>`_)
  
- Change the logging output so that logging messages are not displayed in red, to avoid confusion with errors. (`#3173 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3173>`_)
- Added ``hyperspy.decorators.deprecated`` and ``hyperspy.decorators.deprecated_argument``:

  - Provide consistent and clean deprecation
  - Added a guide for deprecating code (`#3174 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3174>`_)
  
- Add functionality to select navigation position using ``shift`` + click in the navigator. (`#3175 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3175>`_)
- Added a ``plot_residual`` to :py:meth:`~.models.model1d.Model1D.plot`. When ``True``, a residual line (Signal - Model) appears in the model figure. (`#3186 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3186>`_)
- Switch to :meth:`matplotlib.axes.Axes.pcolormesh` for image plots involving non-uniform axes.
  The following cases are covered: 2D-signal with arbitrary navigation-dimension, 1D-navigation and 1D-signal (linescan).
  Not covered are 2D-navigation images (still uses sliders). (`#3192 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3192>`_)
- New :meth:`~.api.signals.BaseSignal.interpolate_on_axis` method to switch one axis of a signal. The data is interpolated in the process. (`#3214 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3214>`_)

.. _hyperspy_2.0_api_changes:

API changes
-----------

- RosettaSciIO was split out of the `HyperSpy repository <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy>`_ on July 23, 2022. The IO-plugins and related functions so far developed in HyperSpy were moved to the `RosettaSciIO repository <https://github.com/hyperspy/rosettasciio>`__. (`#2972 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/2972>`_)
- Extend the IO functions to accept alias names for format ``name`` as defined in RosettaSciIO. (`#3009 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3009>`_)
- Fix behaviour of :meth:`~hyperspy.model.BaseModel.print_current_values`, :meth:`~.component.Component.print_current_values`
  and :func:`~.api.print_known_signal_types`, which were not printing when running from a script - they were only printing when running in notebook or qtconsole. Now all print_* functions behave consistently: they all print the output instead of returning an object (string or html). The :func:`IPython.display.display` will pick a suitable rendering when running in an "ipython" context, for example notebook, qtconsole. (`#3145 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3145>`_)
- The markers have been refactored - see the new :py:mod:`~.api.plot.markers` API and the :ref:`gallery of examples <gallery.markers>` for usage. The new :py:class:`~.api.plot.markers.Markers` uses :py:class:`matplotlib.collections.Collection`, is faster and more generic than the previous implementation and also supports lazy markers. Markers saved in HyperSpy files (``hspy``, ``zspy``) with HyperSpy < 2.0 are converted automatically when loading the file. (`#3148 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3148>`_)
- For all functions with the ``rechunk`` parameter, the default has been changed from ``True`` to ``False``. This means HyperSpy will not automatically try to change the chunking for lazy signals. The old behaviour could lead to a reduction in performance when working with large lazy datasets, for example 4D-STEM data. (`#3166 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3166>`_)
- Renamed ``Signal2D.crop_image`` to :meth:`~.api.signals.Signal2D.crop_signal` (`#3197 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3197>`_)
- Changes and improvement of the map function:

  - Removes the ``parallel`` argument
  - Replace the ``max_workers`` with the ``num_workers`` argument to be consistent with ``dask``
  - Adds more documentation on setting the dask backend and how to use multiple cores
  - Adds ``navigation_chunk`` argument for setting the chunks with a non-lazy signal
  - Fix axes handling when the function to be mapped can be applied to the whole dataset - typically when it has the ``axis`` or ``axes`` keyword argument. (`#3198 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3198>`_)
  
- Remove ``physics_tools`` since it is not used and doesn't fit in the scope of HyperSpy. (`#3235 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3235>`_)
- Improve the readability of the code by replacing the ``__call__`` method of some objects with the more explicit ``_get_current_data``.
 
  - Rename ``__call__`` method of :py:class:`~.api.signals.BaseSignal` to ``_get_current_data``.
  - Rename ``__call__`` method of  :py:class:`hyperspy.model.BaseModel`  to ``_get_current_data``.
  - Remove ``__call__`` method of the :py:class:`hyperspy.component.Component` class. (`#3238 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3238>`_)
  
- Rename ``hyperspy.api.datasets`` to :mod:`hyperspy.api.data` and simplify submodule structure:
  
  - ``hyperspy.api.datasets.artificial_data.get_atomic_resolution_tem_signal2d`` is renamed to :func:`hyperspy.api.data.atomic_resolution_image`
  - ``hyperspy.api.datasets.artificial_data.get_luminescence_signal`` is renamed to :func:`hyperspy.api.data.luminescence_signal`
  - ``hyperspy.api.datasets.artificial_data.get_wave_image`` is renamed to :func:`hyperspy.api.data.wave_image` (`#3253 <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/3253>`_)


API Removal
-----------

As the HyperSpy API evolves, some of its parts are occasionally reorganized or removed.
When APIs evolve, the old API is deprecated and eventually removed in a major
release. The functions and methods removed in HyperSpy 2.0 are listed below along
with migration advises:

Axes
^^^^

- ``AxesManager.show`` has been removed, use :py:meth:`~.axes.AxesManager.gui` instead.
- ``AxesManager.set_signal_dimension`` has been removed, use :py:meth:`~.api.signals.BaseSignal.as_signal1D`,
  :py:meth:`~.api.signals.BaseSignal.as_signal2D` or :py:meth:`~.api.signals.BaseSignal.transpose` of the signal instance instead.

Components
^^^^^^^^^^

- The API of the :py:class:`~.api.model.components1D.Polynomial` has changed (it was deprecated in HyperSpy 1.5). The old API had a single parameters ``coefficients``, which has been replaced by ``a0``, ``a1``, etc.
- The ``legacy`` option (introduced in HyperSpy 1.6) for :class:`~.api.model.components1D.Arctan` has been removed, use :class:`exspy.components.EELSArctan` to use the old API.
- The ``legacy`` option (introduced in HyperSpy 1.6) for :class:`~.api.model.components1D.Voigt` has been removed, use :class:`exspy.components.PESVoigt` to use the old API.

Data Visualization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The ``saturated_pixels`` keyword argument of :py:meth:`~.api.signals.Signal2D.plot` has been removed, use ``vmin`` and/or ``vmax`` instead.
- The ``get_complex`` property of ``hyperspy.drawing.signal1d.Signal1DLine`` has been removed.
- The keyword argument ``line_style`` of :py:func:`~.api.plot.plot_spectra` has been renamed to ``linestyle``.
- Changing navigation coordinates using keyboard ``Arrow`` has been removed, use
  ``Crtl`` + ``Arrow`` instead.
- The ``markers`` submodules can not be imported from the :py:mod:`~.api` anymore, use :py:mod:`hyperspy.api.plot.markers`
  directly, i.e. :class:`hyperspy.api.plot.markers.Arrows`, instead.
- The creation of markers has changed to use their class name instead of aliases, for example,
  use ``m = hs.plot.markers.Lines`` instead of ``m = hs.plot.markers.line_segment``.

Loading and Saving data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following deprecated keyword arguments have been removed during the
migration of the IO plugins to the `RosettaSciIO library
<https://hyperspy.org/rosettasciio/changes.html>`_:

and `new features
<https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3Av1.3+label%3A"type%3A+New+feature">`__.

NEW
---
* :py:meth:`~.api.signals.BaseSignal.rebin` supports upscaling and rebinning to
  arbitrary sizes through linear interpolation. See :ref:`rebin-label`. It also runs faster if `numba <http://numba.pydata.org/>`__ is installed.
* :py:attr:`~.axes.AxesManager.signal_extent` and :py:attr:`~.axes.AxesManager.navigation_extent` properties to easily get the extent of each space.
* New IPywidgets Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements for the `Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org>`__.
  See the new `hyperspy_gui_ipywidgets <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy_gui_ipywidgets>`__ package.
  It is not installed by default, see :ref:`install-label` for details.
* All the :ref:`roi-label` now have a ``gui`` method to display a GUI if
  at least one of HyperSpy's GUI packgages are installed.

Enhancements
------------
* Creating many markers is now much faster.
* New "Stage" metadata node. See :ref:`metadata_structure` for details.
* The Brucker file reader now supports the new version of the format. See :external+rsciio:ref:`bruker-format`.
* HyperSpy is now compatible with all matplotlib backends, including the nbagg which is
  particularly convenient for interactive data analysis in the
  `Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org>`__ in combination with the new
  `hyperspy_gui_ipywidgets <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy_gui_ipywidgets>`__ package.
  See :ref:`importing_hyperspy-label`.
* The ``vmin`` and ``vmax`` arguments of the
  :py:func:`~.api.plot.plot_images` function now accept lists to enable
  setting these parameters for each plot individually.
* The :py:meth:`~.api.signals.BaseSignal.plot_decomposition_results` and
  :py:meth:`~.api.signals.BaseSignal.plot_bss_results` methods now makes a better
  guess of the number of navigators (if any) required to visualise the
  components. (Previously they were always plotting four figures by default.)
* All functions that take a signal range can now take a :py:class:`~.roi.SpanROI`.
* The following ROIs can now be used for indexing or slicing (see :ref:`here <roi-slice-label>` for details):

  * :py:class:`~.api.roi.Point1DROI`
  * :py:class:`~.api.roi.Point2DROI`
  * :py:class:`~.api.roi.SpanROI`
  * :py:class:`~.api.roi.RectangularROI`


API changes
-----------
* Permanent markers (if any) are now displayed when plotting by default.
* HyperSpy no longer depends on traitsui (fixing many installation issues) and
  ipywidgets as the GUI elements based on these packages have now been splitted
  into separate packages and are not installed by default.
* The following methods now raise a ``ValueError`` when not providing the
  number of components if ``output_dimension`` was not specified when
  performing a decomposition. (Previously they would plot as many figures
  as available components, usually resulting in memory saturation):

  * :py:meth:`~.api.signals.BaseSignal.plot_decomposition_results`.
  * :py:meth:`~.api.signals.BaseSignal.plot_decomposition_factors`.

* The default extension when saving to HDF5 following HyperSpy's specification
  is now ``hspy`` instead of ``hdf5``. See :external+rsciio:ref:`hspy-format`.

* The following methods are deprecated and will be removed in HyperSpy 2.0

  * ``.axes.AxesManager.show``. Use :py:meth:`~.axes.AxesManager.gui`
    instead.
  * All ``notebook_interaction`` method. Use the equivalent ``gui`` method
    instead.
  * ``hyperspy.api.signals.Signal1D.integrate_in_range``.
    Use :py:meth:`~.api.signals.BaseSignal.integrate1D` instead.

* The following items have been removed from
  :ref:`preferences <configuring-hyperspy-label>`:

  * ``General.default_export_format``
  * ``General.lazy``
  * ``Model.default_fitter``
  * ``Machine_learning.multiple_files``
  * ``Machine_learning.same_window``
  * ``Plot.default_style_to_compare_spectra``
  * ``Plot.plot_on_load``
  * ``Plot.pylab_inline``
  * ``EELS.fine_structure_width``
  * ``EELS.fine_structure_active``
  * ``EELS.fine_structure_smoothing``
  * ``EELS.synchronize_cl_with_ll``
  * ``EELS.preedge_safe_window_width``
  * ``EELS.min_distance_between_edges_for_fine_structure``

* New ``Preferences.GUIs`` section to enable/disable the installed GUI toolkits.

For developers
--------------
* In addition to adding ipywidgets GUI elements, the traitsui GUI elements have
  been splitted into a separate package. See the new
  `hyperspy_gui_traitsui <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy_gui_traitsui>`__
  package.
* The new ``hyperspy.ui_registry`` enables easy connection of external
  GUI elements to HyperSpy. This is the mechanism used to split the traitsui
  and ipywidgets GUI elements.

.. _changes_0.8.1:

0.8.1 (2015-08-12)
===================

This is a maintenance release. Follow the following links for details on all
the `bugs fixed
<https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A0.8.1+label%3A"type%3A+bug"&utf8=%E2%9C%93>`__,

and `documentation
<https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A0.8.1+label%3Adocumentation>`__ enhancements.

Importantly, the way to start HyperSpy changes in this release. Read :ref:`importing_hyperspy-label` for details.

It also includes some new features and introduces important API changes that
will be fully enforced in Hyperspy 1.0.

New features
------------
* Support for IPython 3.0.
* ``%hyperspy`` IPython magic to easily and transparently import HyperSpy, matplotlib and numpy when using IPython.
* :py:class:`~._components.expression.Expression` model component to easily create analytical function components. More details
  :ref:`here <expression_component-label>`.
* ``hyperspy.signal.Signal.unfolded`` context manager.
* ``hyperspy.signal.Signal.derivative`` method.
* :ref:`syntax to access the components in the model <model_components-label>`
  that includes pretty printing of the components.

API changes
-----------

* ``hyperspy.hspy`` is now deprecated in favour of the new
  :py:mod:`hyperspy.api`. The new API renames and/or move several modules as
  folows:

    * ``hspy.components`` -> ``hyperspy.api.model.components``
    * ``hspy.utils``-> ``hyperspy.api``
    * ``hspy.utils.markers`` ``hyperspy.api.plot.markers``
    * ``hspy.utils.example_signals`` -> ``hyperspy.api.datasets.example_signals``


    In HyperSpy 0.8.1 the full content of ``hyperspy.hspy`` is still
    imported in the user namespace, but this can now be disabled in
    ``hs.preferences.General.import_hspy``. In Hyperspy 1.0 it will be
    disabled by default and the ``hyperspy.hspy`` module will be fully
    removed in HyperSpy 0.10. We encourage all users to migrate to the new
    syntax. For more details see :ref:`importing_hyperspy-label`.
* Indexing the ``hyperspy.signal.Signal`` class is now deprecated. We encourage
  all users to use ``isig`` and ``inav`` instead for indexing.
* ``hyperspy.hspy.create_model`` is now deprecated in favour of the new
  equivalent ``hyperspy.signal.Signal.create_model`` ``Signal`` method.
* ``hyperspy.signal.Signal.unfold_if_multidim`` is deprecated.

  attributes.
* Several widget functions were made internal and/or renamed:
    + ``add_patch_to`` -> ``_add_patch_to``
    + ``set_patch`` -> ``_set_patch``
    + ``onmove`` -> ``_onmousemove``
    + ``update_patch_position`` -> ``_update_patch_position``

0.6.0 (2013-05-25)
===================

New features
------------

* Signal now supports indexing and slicing. See :ref:`signal.indexing`.
* Most arithmetic and rich arithmetic operators work with signal.
  See :ref:`signal.operations`.
* Much improved EELSSpectrum methods:
  ``hyperspy._signals.eels.EELSSpectrum.estimate_zero_loss_peak_centre``,
  ``hyperspy._signals.eels.EELSSpectrum.estimate_elastic_scattering_intensity`` and
  ``hyperspy._signals.eels.EELSSpectrum.estimate_elastic_scattering_threshold``.

* The axes can now be given using their name e.g. ``s.crop("x", 1,10)``
* New syntax to specify position over axes: an integer specifies the indexes
  over the axis and a floating number specifies the position in the axis units
  e.g. ``s.crop("x", 1, 10.)`` crops over the axis `x` (in meters) from index 1
  to value 10 meters. Note that this may make your old scripts behave in
  unexpected ways as just renaming the old \*_in_units and \*_in_values methods
  won't work in most cases.
* Most methods now use the natural order i.e. X,Y,Z.. to index the axes.
* Add padding to fourier-log and fourier-ratio deconvolution to fix the
  wrap-around problem and increase its performance.
* New
  ``hyperspy.components.eels_cl_edge.EELSCLEdge.get_fine_structure_as_spectrum``
  EELSCLEdge method.
* New ``hyperspy.components.arctan.Arctan`` model component.
* New
  ``hyperspy.model.Model.enable_adjust_position``
  and ``hyperspy.model.Model.disable_adjust_position``
  to easily change the position of components using the mouse on the plot.
* New Model methods
  ``hyperspy.model.Model.set_parameters_value``,
  ``hyperspy.model.Model.set_parameters_free`` and
  ``hyperspy.model.Model.set_parameters_not_free``
  to easily set several important component attributes of a list of components
  at once.
* New
  :py:func:`~.api.stack` function to stack signals.
* New Signal methods:
  ``hyperspy.signal.Signal.integrate_simpson``,
  ``hyperspy.signal.Signal.max``,
  ``hyperspy.signal.Signal.min``,
  ``hyperspy.signal.Signal.var``, and
  ``hyperspy.signal.Signal.std``.
* New sliders window to easily navigate signals with navigation_dimension > 2.
* The Ripple (rpl) reader can now read rpl files produced by INCA.

-----------
* The following functions has been renamed or removed:

    * components.EELSCLEdge

        * knots_factor -> fine_structure_smoothing
        * edge_position -> onset_energy
        * energy_shift removed

    * components.Voigt.origin -> centre
    * signals.Signal1D

        * find_peaks_1D -> Signal.find_peaks1D_ohaver
        * align_1D -> Signal.align1D
        * shift_1D -> Signal.shift1D
        * interpolate_1D -> Signal.interpolate1D

    * Signal

        * split_in -> split
        * crop_in_units -> crop
        * crop_in_pixels -> crop

  Signal.__init__ takes keywords e.g with  a new syntax .
  ``>>> s = signals.Signal1D(np.arange(10))`` instead of
  ``>>> s = signals.Signal1D({'data' : np.arange(10)})``
