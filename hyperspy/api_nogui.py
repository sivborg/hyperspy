Functions:

    :func:`~.api.get_configuration_directory_path`
        Return the configuration directory path.

    :func:`~.api.interactive`
        Define operations that are automatically recomputed on event changes.

    :func:`~.api.load`
        Load data into BaseSignal instances from supported files.

    :data:`~.api.preferences`
        Preferences class instance to configure the default value of different
        parameters. It has a CLI and a GUI that can be started by execting its
        `gui` method i.e. `preferences.gui()`.

    :func:`~.api.print_known_signal_types`
        Print all known `signal_type`.

    :func:`~.api.set_log_level`
        Convenience function to set HyperSpy's the log level.

    :func:`~.api.stack`
        Stack several signals.

    :func:`~.api.transpose`
        Transpose a signal.

The :mod:`~.api` package contains the following submodules/packages:

    :mod:`~.api.signals`
        `Signal` classes which are the core of HyperSpy. Use this modules to
        create `Signal` instances manually from numpy arrays. Note that to
        load data from supported file formats is more convenient to use the
        `load` function.
    :mod:`~.api.model`
        Components that can be used to create a model for curve fitting.
    :mod:`~.api.plot`
        Plotting functions that operate on multiple signals.
    :mod:`~.api.data`
        Synthetic datasets.
    :mod:`~.api.roi`
        Region of interests (ROIs) that operate on `BaseSignal` instances and
        include widgets for interactive operation.
    :mod:`~.api.samfire`
        SAMFire utilities (strategies, Pool, fit convergence tests)
