The Signal class and its specialized subclasses:

BaseSignal
    For generic data with arbitrary signal_dimension. All other signal
    classes inherit from this one. It should only be used with none of
    the others is appropriated.
Signal1D
    For generic data with signal_dimension equal 1, i.e. spectral data of
    n-dimensions. The signal is unbinned by default.
Signal2D
    For generic data with signal_dimension equal 2, i.e. image data of
    n-dimensions. The signal is unbinned by default.
ComplexSignal
    For generic complex data with arbitrary signal_dimension.
ComplexSignal1D
    For generic complex data with signal_dimension equal 1, i.e. spectral
    data of n-dimensions. The signal is unbinned by default.
ComplexSignal2D
    For generic complex data with signal_dimension equal 2, i.e. image
    data of n-dimensions. The signal is unbinned by default.
