    """Check if the calibration of two Axis objects matches.

    Raises a logger warning if there is a mismatch.
    ``scale`` and ``offset`` are compared as floats
    using np.allclose, while ``units`` is compared
    with a simple inequality (!=).

    Parameters
    ----------
    ax1, ax2 : Axis objects
        Axes objects that should be compared.
    rtol : float
        Tolerance passed to `np.allclose` for comparison. Default 1e-7.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        If the two axes have identical calibrations.
