            The units in which majors and minors are given; ``"width"`` and
            ``"height"`` refer to the dimensions of the axes, while ``"x"`` and ``"y"``
            refer to the *offsets* data units. ``"xy"`` differs from all others in
            that the angle as plotted varies with the aspect ratio, and equals
            the specified angle only when the aspect ratio is unity.  Hence
            it behaves the same as the :class:`matplotlib.patches.Ellipse` with
            ``axes.transData`` as its transform.
