        ----------
        segments : numpy.ndarray
            Must be with shape [n, 2, 2] ragged array with shape (n, 2, 3) at every navigation position.
            Defines the lines[[[x1,y1],[x2,y2]], ...] of the center of the ellipse.

            Additional keyword arguments are passed to :class:`matplotlib.collections.LineCollection`.

        Notes
        -----
        Unlike markers using ``offsets`` argument, the positions of the segments
        are defined by the ``segments`` argument and the tranform specifying the
        coordinate system of the ``segments`` is ``transform``.
